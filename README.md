## Messaging App Project

This is the backend repository for the Full Stack Messaging App Project built for the [Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-messaging-app).

The goal of the project was to build a messaging web app that allows users to send and receive real-time messages.

Frontend part is using react/typescript, backend - Express.js/MongoDB. Both are written in typescript.

The Socket.IO library was used for the real-time communication functionality between the project's client and server.
